## To-Do

- [x] Create founding tree structure
- [x] Create hashtable for aliasing
- [x] Implement prime finding algorithm to find next greatest prime
- [ ] Array-based implementation for node children
- [ ] Use hashing for O(1) finding of children
- [ ] Implement hashing based traversal
- [ ] Better find function (possibly trie based)

### Optional

- [ ] Implement vectors in c (using function pointers if possible)
- [ ] Use Miller-Rabin for prime finding for faster (but probabilistic) computation
