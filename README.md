Repo for the DSA Mini-project Directory Manager

## To-Do

- [x] Create founding tree structure
- [x] Create hashtable for aliasing
- [x] Implement prime finding algorithm to find next greatest prime
- [X] Array-based implementation for node children
- [X] Use hashing for O(1) finding of children
- [X] Implement hashing based traversal
- [X] Better find function (possibly trie based)
- [X] Add `cd` relative path functionality

### Styling

- [ ] Move comments to header files and follow a common standard
- [ ] Move standard library header file includes to .h files instead of .c

### Optional

- [ ] Implement vectors in c (using function pointers if possible in order to emulate classes)
- [ ] Use Miller-Rabin for prime finding for faster (but probabilistic) computation
